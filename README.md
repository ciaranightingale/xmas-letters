# Christmas Letters App

Imagine if you could send Christmas letters to people, onchain, without anyone being able to see the content of the message you sent or that you sent it (or even that you sent a Christmas letter at all)?

With Aztec, this is possible!

This application allows you to send a Christmas letter to someone, without anyone being able to know that you sent it or what you said. The reciever can only see the content of the messages sent to them, not who sent them.

An observer would only know that transactions were Christmas letter trabsactions but not what they said or who sent it.
